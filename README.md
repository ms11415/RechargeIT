# RechargeIT
Skills based assessments (SBA) from the RechargeIT curriculum

The Java/JPA/JUnit SBA task was to build a school management system where students can register to 
courses, and view the course assigned to them.  Only students with right credentials can login. Otherwise, an
error message is displayed.  Detailed project specifications can be found in the PDF file "Java_SBA Project
Requirements."

The Javascript/HTML/CSS SBA tested skills on implementing a clean HTML structure that follows the methodologies 
of visual design, styling a site so that it is user-friendly, and basic scripting with JavaScript. Detailed 
project specifications can be found in the PDF file "Javascript_SBA Project Requirements."
